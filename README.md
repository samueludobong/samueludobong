## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samuel from Nigeria, and I am a Python GUI Developer. I can create amazing-looking and fully functional GUI applications. I am somewhat fluent in CSS and am currently learning UI/UX, Android Development, Java, and Node.js to expand my skill set. I am 100% computer literate and my skills extend beyond programming, as I can also serve as an IT personnel. I enjoy working in teams and hope you will enjoy my company as well.
